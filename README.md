- ## Approach 1:- Bubble Sort 

    - ### **Intuition**
        The problem involves sorting an array of integers under the constraint that two adjacent elements can only be swapped if they have the same number of `1` bits (set bits) in their binary representation. The challenge is to determine if it is possible to sort the array given this restriction.

        - The core idea is to use a **modified bubble sort** approach, where we repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if:
        1. The elements are out of order (i.e., the current element is greater than the next element).
        2. They have the **same number of `1` bits** in their binary representation.
        
        - If two elements have different numbers of `1` bits, they cannot be swapped, and the sorting is not possible under the given constraints.

        - The problem boils down to checking if the array can be sorted using a bubble sort-like approach, but with a specific restriction on which pairs of elements can be swapped.

    - ### **Approach**
        1. **Bubble Sort Simulation**:
            - We simulate **bubble sort**, where we compare adjacent elements in the array.
            - If the current element is greater than the next one, we attempt to swap them, but only if they have the same number of `1` bits in their binary representation.
            - If any adjacent elements have different numbers of `1` bits, we immediately return `false` since we can't swap them.

        2. **Counting 1-bits**:
            - For each comparison, we need to determine if two elements have the same number of `1` bits in their binary representation. This can be done efficiently by counting the number of `1` bits in each elementâ€™s binary form.
        
        3. **Optimizing with Early Termination**:
            - If, during a full pass through the array, no swaps occur, it means the array is already sorted. We can break out of the loop early, improving performance in already sorted arrays.
        
        4. **Final Result**:
            - If we can successfully sort the array with the given condition (only swapping elements with the same number of `1` bits), return `true`.
            - If any swap is blocked because the `1` bit counts differ, return `false`.

    - ### **Time Complexity**
        - **Outer Loop (Bubble Sort)**: The outer loop of the algorithm simulates bubble sort and runs up to `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
        
        - **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares adjacent elements for each pass of the outer loop. In the worst case, it runs `(n - 1)` times in the first pass, `(n - 2)` times in the second pass, and so on.

        - **Counting 1-bits**: For each comparison, we need to calculate the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of each element. Counting bits can be done in constant time, __O(1)__, since the number of bits is fixed (32 or 64 bits for standard integer types).

        Thus, the time complexity is dominated by the nested loops: __O(n<sup>2</sup>)__, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

    - ### **Space Complexity**
        - **Input Array Copy**: We create a copy of the input array to avoid modifying the original. This requires __O(n)__ space, where `n` is the number of elements.

        - **Auxiliary Space for Counting Bits**: The auxiliary space used for counting bits is constant, __O(1)__, since we use a fixed-size bitset or simple binary operations to count the bits of each number.

        Thus, the overall space complexity is: __O(n)__ due to the space required to store the copied array.

                                    is_already_sorted = False  # Since we swapped, the array is not sorted yet.
