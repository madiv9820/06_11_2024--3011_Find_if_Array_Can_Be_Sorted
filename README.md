- ## Approach 1 :- Bubble Sort 

    - ### **Intuition**
        The problem involves sorting an array of integers under the constraint that two adjacent elements can only be swapped if they have the same number of `1` bits (set bits) in their binary representation. The challenge is to determine if it is possible to sort the array given this restriction.

        - The core idea is to use a **modified bubble sort** approach, where we repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if:
        1. The elements are out of order (i.e., the current element is greater than the next element).
        2. They have the **same number of `1` bits** in their binary representation.
        
        - If two elements have different numbers of `1` bits, they cannot be swapped, and the sorting is not possible under the given constraints.

        - The problem boils down to checking if the array can be sorted using a bubble sort-like approach, but with a specific restriction on which pairs of elements can be swapped.

    - ### **Approach**
        1. **Bubble Sort Simulation**:
            - We simulate **bubble sort**, where we compare adjacent elements in the array.
            - If the current element is greater than the next one, we attempt to swap them, but only if they have the same number of `1` bits in their binary representation.
            - If any adjacent elements have different numbers of `1` bits, we immediately return `false` since we can't swap them.

        2. **Counting 1-bits**:
            - For each comparison, we need to determine if two elements have the same number of `1` bits in their binary representation. This can be done efficiently by counting the number of `1` bits in each elementâ€™s binary form.
        
        3. **Optimizing with Early Termination**:
            - If, during a full pass through the array, no swaps occur, it means the array is already sorted. We can break out of the loop early, improving performance in already sorted arrays.
        
        4. **Final Result**:
            - If we can successfully sort the array with the given condition (only swapping elements with the same number of `1` bits), return `true`.
            - If any swap is blocked because the `1` bit counts differ, return `false`.

    - ### **Time Complexity**
        - **Outer Loop (Bubble Sort)**: The outer loop of the algorithm simulates bubble sort and runs up to `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
        
        - **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares adjacent elements for each pass of the outer loop. In the worst case, it runs `(n - 1)` times in the first pass, `(n - 2)` times in the second pass, and so on.

        - **Counting 1-bits**: For each comparison, we need to calculate the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of each element. Counting bits can be done in constant time, __O(1)__, since the number of bits is fixed (32 or 64 bits for standard integer types).

        Thus, the time complexity is dominated by the nested loops: __O(n<sup>2</sup>)__, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

    - ### **Space Complexity**
        - **Input Array Copy**: We create a copy of the input array to avoid modifying the original. This requires __O(n)__ space, where `n` is the number of elements.

        - **Auxiliary Space for Counting Bits**: The auxiliary space used for counting bits is constant, __O(1)__, since we use a fixed-size bitset or simple binary operations to count the bits of each number.

        Thus, the overall space complexity is: __O(n)__ due to the space required to store the copied array.

    - ### Code

                                    arr[index], arr[index + 1] = arr[index + 1], arr[index]  # Swap the elements
                                    is_already_sorted = False  # Since we swapped, the array is not sorted yet.
                                else:
                                    # If they have different numbers of 1-bits, we cannot swap them, so return False.
                                    return False
                        
                        # If no swaps were made in this iteration, the array is already sorted.
                        if is_already_sorted:
                            break
                    
                    return True  # If we successfully sorted the array (or determined it can be sorted), return True.

            };
            ```

- ## Approach 2 :- Segment-Based Validation

    - ### Intuition:
        - The problem asks whether the array can be sorted under a specific condition: numbers can only be swapped if they have the same number of `1`-bits (set bits) in their binary representation. The key observation is that the array can be sorted if and only if, for any contiguous segment of numbers with the same number of `1`-bits, the smallest number in the segment is greater than the largest number from the previous segment. This ensures that there are no "inversions" in the order of numbers with different bit-counts.

    - ### Approach:
        1. **Helper Function**: We define a helper function `count_Bits(val)` that computes the number of set bits (`1`-bits) in the binary representation of a number. This will help us group numbers with the same bit-count together.

        2. **Segment Tracking**: As we iterate through the array, we track numbers that have the same number of set bits as the previous numbers, forming contiguous "segments" of numbers with the same bit-count. For each segment:
            - Track the smallest (`current_min`) and largest (`current_max`) numbers.
            - When the bit-count changes, check if the current segment's minimum number is greater than the maximum of the previous segment. If it isn't, we return `False`.
        
        3. **Final Check**: After iterating through all numbers, ensure that the last segment's minimum number is greater than the maximum number of the previous segment.

        4. **Termination Condition**: If the above checks pass for all segments, the array can be sorted according to the given condition, so we return `True`.

    - ### Time Complexity:
        - **Helper Function**: The `count_Bits` function runs in constant time, as it processes a fixed number of bits (typically 32 bits for integers in most programming environments).
        
        - **Iteration**: We iterate through the entire list of `n` numbers, and for each number, we call `count_Bits` which runs in constant time. Therefore, the time complexity of the iteration is `O(n)`.

        Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list.

    - ### Space Complexity:
        - **Auxiliary Space**: The space used by the algorithm is mainly for storing variables such as `current_min`, `current_max`, and `previous_max`, all of which take constant space.
        
        - **No Extra Data Structures**: The algorithm does not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

        Thus, the space complexity is **O(1)** (constant space).
